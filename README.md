Framework for selenium automation

#About Myself
I am Balaji Makam working in software testing field from past 4.5 years and got experienced in various types of testing like Functinal, automation, sap and Performance testing.
I am interested in learning new technologies and coding. I got inspired with Selenium Object Bank project so I thought to do user friendly automation framework with the combination of multiple successful projects which are currently available in internet.
